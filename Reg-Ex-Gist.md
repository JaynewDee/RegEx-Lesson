# Understanding Regular Expressions

*This gist serves as a standard introduction to the essential understanding required to write and use Regular Expressions in our code.*    
> **Let's jump right in!**

## *What is a Regular Expression?* (RegEx)

`/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`

> Whether one is familiar with some of the standard tools used in programming or just starting out on their coding journey, the line of code above will likely appear cryptic, and perhaps even non-sensical.  
But this series of characters is in fact a very commonly used way for programmers to get very specific about the kind of instructions they write to a computer.  It is called a Regular Expression, commonly referred to as a "RegEx", and this lesson is intended to illuminate and clarify the essential syntactical rules that Regular Expressions use to represent a possible value.  
The RegEx shown above is an example of one that can be used to check, or validate, if a URL string is formatted properly, and it will serve us well as we discuss the key concepts covered throughout this lesson.

>> Take one more hard look at the RegEx above, and do your best to guess at where the patterns lie.
